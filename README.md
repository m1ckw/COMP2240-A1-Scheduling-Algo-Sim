# COMP2240-A1-Scheduling-Algo-Sim - 70% (lost 20% due to missing Algorithm)

TASK:
Write a program that simulates First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), Multi-level Feedback (Variable) (FBV) and Lottery (LTR) scheduling algorithms. 
For each algorithm, the program should list the order and time of the jobs being loaded in the CPU. 
Compute the turnaround time and waiting time for every job as well as the average turnaround time and average waiting time for the set of processes.

Did Not Complete the last Algorithm due to time contraints (FBV).
